# TG-Hack
TG:Hack is a (semi) onsite jeopardy style CTF hosted every year at Norway's largest LAN party The Gathering, which takes place at the Viking ship in Hamar. We focus on making guiding tasks for beginners, and challenging tasks for a little more experienced CTFers.

We have a pre-contest for beginners, starting 15th of February. The main competition starts 17th of April, 18.00 (CET), and ends 20th of April 18.00.

By semi-onsite CTF, we mean that some of our tasks are published publicly and some are only for onsite participants. This is in order to meet The Gatherings' requirements to only make onsite participants able to win prizes and make it more exclusive to participate onsite. The 'hard' and 'crazy' difficulties will only be published for onsite participants

After the main competition has ended, we open all tasks publicly for learning purposes. The site will be up until January 1st 2020.

Writeups will be published at https://github.com/tghack after the competition has ended.
